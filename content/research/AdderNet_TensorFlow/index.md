This is a A TensorFlow Implementation of AdderNet. The original paper, AdderNet ([H. Chen, et al., AdderNet: Do We Really Need Multiplications in Deep Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13200)), is implemented with PyTorch. Here we provide a TensorFlow alternative for training and evaluating the Adder layer operator and related network backbones.
