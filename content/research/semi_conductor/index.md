- Helped [Prof. YAO Yuan](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/people/faculty/profile/yuany/) and the Nexperia company with the Nexperia semi‚Äêconductor classification problem;
- Distinguished broken chips from normal chips by using deep learning and image classification methods;
- Compared the difference of perform between different models, e.g., ResNet20, ResNet56;
- Tried transferred learning methods. It turned out that a ResNet56 model transferred from a pretrained ResNet20 model could perform better, than simply training a ResNet56 model directly.
