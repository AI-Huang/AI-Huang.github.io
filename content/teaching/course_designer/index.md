Many people are interested about start-ups on education industries in Hong Kong. During Apr. 2019 to May. 2019, I served as Course Designer to help several entrepreneurship founders design lectures and courses to introduce knowledge in the university to common high school students.

I designed a lecture which introduces the prelimilary background of ECE. {{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} Download my <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WF-Nrc0zMbXW6NHoZSGQavefwHPqnoOU/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115182618927559529877&rtpof=true&sd=true">PPT on Introduction to ECE</a>.

In the meanwhile, I have designed several tiny embedded projects to enhance the understanding of the background of ECE:

- Running Water Lights;
- Electronic Voter.
