I have served as Teaching Assistant for one year and a half at HKUST. Courses I served as TA:

- ELEC2600: Stochastic Processes
- ELEC6910R: Robotic Perception and Learning

ELEC6910R is a very interesting course about deep learning and robotics taught by my supervisor <a target="_blank" href="https://ram-lab.com/people/">Prof. Ming LIU</a>.
